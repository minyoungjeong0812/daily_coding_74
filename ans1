##input: N for the matrix dimensions and X for the checker.
##output: Integer for how many times "X" showed up in NXN matrix

##questions to ask: can N be 0? can X be 0? any upper limit for N or X? The problem just said integers. Can they be negative then? (I doubt)


##My 1st try

def mul_find(N,X):
  counter=0
  for i in range(1,N+1):
    if X % i == 0 and X // i <= N:
       counter+=1
       
   return counter
       
  
## MY 2nd try (dealing with excursions: cannot find)

def mul_find(N,X):
  counter=0
  
  if N ==0:
    return 0
    
  if N==1 and N!=X:
    return 0
  
  for i in range(1,N+1):
    if X % i == 0 and X // i <= N:
       counter+=1
    
   return counter
